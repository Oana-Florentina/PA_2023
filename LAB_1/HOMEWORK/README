Homework 

Let n be an integer given as a command line argument. Validate the argument!
Create a n x n Latin Square as a matrix, having as symbols numbers from 1 to n.
For each line, and each column of the matrix, create and display on the screen String objects representing the concatenation of the symbols in the respective line or column.
For larger n display ONLY the running time of the application in nanoseconds or milliseconds. Try n > 30_000. You might want to adjust the JVM Heap Space using the VM options -Xms4G -Xmx4G.
Launch the application from the command line, for example: java Lab1 9.

Homework:
-Create a class that describes an instance of the problem.(done)
-Override the Object.equals method for the Location and Road classes. The problem should not allow adding the same location or road twice.(done)
-Instead of using an enum, create dedicated classes either for locations: cities, air ports, gas stations etc. or roads: highway, express, country, etc.
Each concrete location class may have additional specific propertes (population, number of terminals, gas price, etc.)(done)
-Implement a method that determines if a problem's instance is valid.(done?)
-Implement an algorithm for determining if it is possible to go from one location to another using the given roads.(done)
-Write doc comments in your source code and generate the class documentation using javadoc.(done)
